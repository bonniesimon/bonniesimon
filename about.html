                <p>
                    My first experience with programming was at a very young age. My first programming language was called
                    LOGO. It was where you moved a turtle using commands. This was probably one factor which made me
                    fell in love with computers!(along with video games). Currently I'm doing the best when doing HTML, CSS and am conquering the
                    JS world. Also I do backend programming using Nodejs.

            </div>
            <div class="right-intro-container">
                <p>
                    I've never noticed the designer in me until I started doing frontend development. But I was always
                    concerned about how things looked. I started using the internet without any help from anyone, and
                    I've learned to judge things based on their look; i.e I'd know if something is a spam/fake by
                    looking at it. Maybe this is where it stemmed. Creating CLI applications for me meant making the output
                    screen as beautiful even though its just black and white. Even a wrong indent or no '\n' at the end of the output triggered me.

            <div class="right-intro-container">
                <p>
                    I am lot into video editing. I envied having a video recording camera when I was a child. And when I
                    finally got one, I started joining several clips to make films. Of course I was young and dumb, and
                    those films were bad, but the thing is that I enjoyed making those. I have made a few ones that are
                    worth putting out there and are on my insta page. Peter Mckinnon, Sam Kolder, etc are some people I
                    look up to in this craft. Whenever I travel somewhere new my main goal is to make a cinematic video
                    of the trip rather than enjoy what's in front of my eyes.

            <div class="right-intro-container">
                <p>
                    Even though video games might not be a technical skill, they played a vital role in me choosing
                    Engineering. Video games taught me to solve problems. Whenever I tried to install games, there's
                    always one problem or another that comes up. Sometimes its a 0xc000007b error or a DLL missing error
                    or some other errors. And due to my passion for gaming, I'd always google my way through to the
                    answer. Solving these errors taught me 'how to google',which is a must for a developer(hehe),and is a
                    very important skill that most people lack these days.

                    I love listening to songs. But I am not a person who listens to music on his free time. Rather, I
                    mostly listen to music while I do something, like when I'm in transit or while coding. I like most
                    genres, usually depending on my mood. And I really like people who recommend songs to me.

                    interest for them. Deathnote and Monster are, for me, some of the best ones I've seen.

                    Atom is one of the first code editors I have tried. Later I switched to vscode when atom got too sluggish to use. 
                    I am pretty happy with Vscode. I later switched to neovim to learn the "vim experience" that every dev talks about. Not gonna lie, I don't feel like I wanna use the mouse anymore! But now I'm using the vim plugin for vscode.
